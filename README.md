We're using mdBook to generate static pages and we're hosting it via our Web API.  

## USAGE

To get started, install mdbook and run `mdbook build` from the root of this repository, it will create a `book/` directory which will contain the generated static html content.  

You can now use `mdbook serve` to launch a local instance and see your changes live. This will also reload upon modification.  

After the modification, you may push your changes on a new branch and make a pull request.
