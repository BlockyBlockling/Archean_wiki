# Game modes
In Archean, there are different game modes. Each game mode has its own rules and objectives based on the type of player you are.

### Creative
In creative mode, you have access to all the blocks and items in the game directly in your inventory. You can freely build any structures and vehicles you want. Here are the specific characteristics of creative mode:
- Blueprints can be loaded without having the necessary components.
- The OwnerPad checkpoint system saves the state of batteries and tanks.
- The respawn shortcut accessible via the `F10` key allows you to respawn without dropping the contents of your inventory.
- Mining and crafting are available, but not necessary for building structures or vehicles.

> - You can reset your inventory using the RESET button available at the top of your inventory.


### Adventure
In adventure mode, you start with an empty inventory and must collect resources to craft the necessary components for building structures and vehicles. Here are the specific characteristics of adventure mode:
- Blueprints cannot be loaded without having the necessary components in your inventory.
- The OwnerPad checkpoint system does not restore the state of batteries and tanks.
- The respawn shortcut accessible via the `F10` key drops the contents of your inventory in a box at your location before the respawn.
- Mining and crafting are necessary for building structures or vehicles.

### Survival
The survival mode is not yet available in the game. It will be added in a future update.

## Changing the gamemode of an existing world
You can change the game mode of an existing world at any time using the launcher.
To do this, if you have a creative world named "World1" and you want to switch it to Adventure mode, simply create a new Adventure world named "World1". This action will not create a new world, but will modify the game mode of the existing world.
