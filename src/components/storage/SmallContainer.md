# Description
The container is a storage component with a capacity of 25 slots.
It is equipped with two ports for connecting item conduits to receive or send items.

The data port allows retrieving the content of the container as a string using the [key-value system](/xenoncode/documentation.md#key-value-objects).

>- *The container does not have the ability to directly pull or push items from its ports, it is solely a storage component.*
