# Description
The Enrichment Centrifuge component separates a mixture of molecules into two distinct flows based on their molecular mass.

# Usage
It requires:
- A continuous electrical power supply of 1,000 Watts.
- A data input to activate it.

Fluid is injected through a port located at the very top of the component. At the bottom, the lighter molecules exit through a port positioned higher, while the heavier molecules exit through a lower port directly beneath it.

Both output ports must be properly connected to ensure correct operation.
