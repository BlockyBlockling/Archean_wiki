# Description
The Steam Turbine component converts the thermal energy of hot steam into electrical energy.

# Usage
It operates by injecting hot water steam into its fluid input. The hotter the steam and the higher the flow rate, the more energy it can produce.

At full capacity, it can deliver up to approximately **27 megawatts**.

A fluid output connection is required. Without it, the turbine won't be able to expel the steam and will not produce any energy.

- Minimum operating temperature: 373 K  
- Maximum effective temperature: 650 K (optimal operation)  
- Maximum flow rate: 100 kg/s  

The generated energy is directly delivered to a high-voltage electrical output.  

When the power is not fully consumed, it will automatically bypass the turbine to keep it at a maximum rotation rate.
This effect will cause the output fluid to not cool down as much.
