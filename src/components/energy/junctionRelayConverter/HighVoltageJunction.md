# Description
The high voltage junction allows distributing energy to 4 ports to provide power to multiple components from a single power source.

> - The high voltage junction does not allow combining energy by using it in reverse, it works in one direction only.
> - The available power is distributed dynamically based on demand, allowing junctions to be chained freely to supply components as needed.
> - You can monitor the power consumption of each port as well as the input power from the information window accessible with the `V` key.
