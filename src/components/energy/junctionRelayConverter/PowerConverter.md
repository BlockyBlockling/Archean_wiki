# Description

The power converter is a device that converts high voltage energy to low voltage energy and vice versa.

This device is useful, for example, to power a computer from a high voltage battery if ports are available and to avoid adding a low voltage battery. However, if you want to power a high voltage component from a low voltage battery, you will of course still be limited in terms of total power output based on the low voltage battery's output.
