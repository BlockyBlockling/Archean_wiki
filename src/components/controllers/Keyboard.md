# Description
The Keyboard is a component that provides a touch-sensitive keyboard for sending alphanumeric values to other components.

# Usage
You can enter a alphanumerical value using the touch buttons of the keyboard by pressing the `F` key, and they will be displayed on the Keyboard screen but only become effective/updated when the validation button (green) is pressed.

The yellow button allows you to delete the last entered character, while the red button allows you to clear everything.

> - `^` Allows switching between lowercase and uppercase
> - `!?` Displays special characters
