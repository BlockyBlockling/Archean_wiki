# Description
The speed sensor allows you to send the relative speed to the parent object (Planet, mothership...) through its data port.

# Usage
Once placed on your build, it can be connected to a computer, for example, to retrieve your speed in meters per second. The orientation of the speed sensor has no impact on its functionality.
