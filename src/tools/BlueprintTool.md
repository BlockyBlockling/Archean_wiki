# Description
The Blueprint Tool allows you to save a copy of an build. Blueprints are saved in the `(Client Settings)/blueprints` folder in `.json` format, one per blueprint with it's respective name.

With this system, you can transfer your builds to other worlds or servers, share them with friends or simply duplicate a build.

# Usage
- `Left-click` to scan and save a blueprint of the target build.
- `Right-click` to open the interface displaying your blueprints.

To spawn a blueprint, you need to open the blueprint interface and select the desired blueprint.  
You can then freely move the selection using a hologram of your selected blueprint. A long `left-click` will spawn it, while a `right-click` will cancel the operation and go back to scan mode.

You may also spawn a blueprint on top of an existing build to add the parts to it by quickly pressing `left-click` before making finer adjustments.  
Once you're happy with how it's placed, you can hold `left-click` for two seconds to permanently spawn it, merged with the target build.

>- *If an OwnerPad has been added, you must have the "Build" permission to save a blueprint of the build you're aiming.*
