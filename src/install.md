## AMD Graphics Cards
<font color="orange">
Archean can run with an AMD graphics card (RDNA2 architecture or newer - RX 6000 series and above). Performance may be lower compared to NVIDIA cards due to two factors:

- NVIDIA's DLSS technology providing better optimization
- More mature ray-tracing driver support on NVIDIA cards

Some glitches and artifacts may appear with AMD cards. If you need help optimizing your settings with an AMD card, feel free to join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/GeuskE6CmF) for assistance and additional information.

## Intel ARC Graphics Cards
<font color="red">
Intel ARC graphics cards are not compatible with Archean due to the lack of support for double precision floats in shaders (shaderfloat64).
